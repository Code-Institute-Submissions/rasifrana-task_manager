## Features

### Visual representation of portfolio

To beat the Simon game, players need to remember the color pattern and repeat it by pressing the colored buttons on the game unit in the correct order. It starts off at a nice steady pace, but the more you play, the more complicated the patterns become, building suspense with each turn. Players try to hit a new high score by completing the longest sequence possible without messing up.
